# iot-open-data
An open repository of sample data obtained from real life IoT devices. 

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is provide a reference data schema for implementing large scale IoT projects for everyone. One of the biggest challenges for developing an IoT analytics solution is to find the right kind of data and play with it. Often this data is either unavailable or not exactly what you've been looking for. We are solving this problem by building the tools to create that data for yourself, in a fast, easy and intuitive way. However, such tools are often a shot in the dark in absence of real life data.

# How to contribute
If you have a implemented a real life project in IoT and would like to share the knowledge with others, please contribute by adding a sample JSON output for a single database record. We are not interested in the complete dataset, rather we would like to know which data fields are required for a real life project.

Simply clone this repo and submit a pull request. Proper comments will be welcome.
